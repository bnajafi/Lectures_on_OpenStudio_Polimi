# Lectures_on_OpenStudio_Polimi

In this repository you can find the required files of my lectures on "Building Energy Simulation using OpenStudi" which are held in Politecnico di Milano.

In case you are following this course in the context of M.Sc. couse of "Technical Environmental Systems", please make sure you have filled in the following survey: https://goo.gl/forms/MC5MowvX5dCo2BLE3

In order to follow these Lectures you will need to have SketchUp Make, EnergyPlus, and OpenStudio installed on your computer. You can find the installation files of these software which are coherent with your operating system (including Windows, Mac, and Linux) in the following links:

SketchUp make: https://www.sketchup.com/download/all
EnergyPlus: https://energyplus.net/downloads
OpenStudio: https://www.openstudio.net/downloads

In case you are using 64 bit windows and any of the mentioned websites are down, you can download the corresponding files from the following link: https://goo.gl/QKp9P7

Furthermore, it is noteworthy that, in case you already have the SketchUp software installed on your computer, you might have to re-install it as the OpenStudio version might not be compatible with your installed version of SketchUp. In order to check whether you have correctly installed the above-mentioned softwares, you should verify that you have the OpenStudio add-on added to your SketchUp tools.

In our lessons we are going to use NREL's Building component library, in order to follow the corresponding lecture, you should  go the NREL's Building Component Library's Website (https://bcl.nrel.gov/) and create an account.  In the latter website, once you create an account, you are given a unique API key in your dashboard. You should save this number so that it would be easily accessible for you.
